# Bank Transaction Email Reader

The intention of this project is to read emails coming from a bank regarding information of a transaction.

The output right now is an csv file delimited by pipes ("|") but the goal is to return a json with all the information so you can be able to use this on your mobile, desktop or web applications.

Output Example:

    date|currency|amount|merchant|status|type|
    21/12/19 23:40|RD|91.12|None|Reversada|Compra
    21/12/19 23:40|RD|91.12|UBR* PENDING.UBER.COM|Aprobada|Compra
    21/12/19 20:32|RD|125.53|UBR* PENDING.UBER.COM|Aprobada|Compra

:alarm_clock: Pending


## The current supported banks are:
  - Banco BHD LeÃ³n (Dominican Republic) :white_check_mark:
  - Banco Vimenca (Dominican Republic) :construction:

## Known Major Tasks TODO

  1. When running the main file, one parameter should be the user email to determine which mail service to use
  2. Right now it's only expecting multipart emails (threads) not single messages
  3. How to handle email credentials?
  4. How to handle email authentication token?
  5. Add Outlook Email service
  6. Add a new Email Service 
     1. Currently only Gmail is supported. Stay tunned for instructions on how to add a new service. 

## The current supported email services are:
  - Gmail: Using the Google api with readonly permission

## How to Execute

  - Python versions that I can assure this work with: 
    >3.6.9
    
  - You, as a developer, need a `credential.json` file provided by Gmail with the `readonly gmail api` activated. The file should be placed along side the `main.py` file. You can find instructions on how to get it from this [Quickstart Guide](https://developers.google.com/gmail/api/quickstart/python). It looks something like this:
  ```json
  {
    "installed": {
        "client_id": "the_cliente_id",
        "project_id": "the_project_id",
        "auth_uri": "https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth",
        "token_uri": "https://oauth2.googleapis.com/token",
        "auth_provider_x509_cert_url": "https://www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v1/certs",
        "client_secret": "the_client_secret",
        "redirect_uris": [
            "urn:ietf:wg:oauth:2.0:oob",
            "http://localhost"
        ]
    }
  }
  ```
  - Install requirements: `python -m pip install -r requirements.txt`
  - After having that, all you need is run:
    - `python main.py bhdleon example@gmail.com`
